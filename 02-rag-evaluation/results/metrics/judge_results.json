    "generated_answer": "Impairment for individual assets is determined by reviewing the carrying amounts of the assets at each reporting date to identify any indicators of impairment. If such indicators exist, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated. The recoverable amount is defined as the higher of the asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the specific risks associated with the asset. If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount, and an impairment loss is recognized in profit or loss.",
    "expected_answer": "The carrying amounts of the company's assets are reviewed at each statement of financial position date to determine whether there are indicators of impairment.

    "generated_answer": "The responsibilities of the Directors and the limitations of the Auditor's responsibilities interact in a way that significantly influences the overall reliability of the financial statements. \n\nThe Directors are tasked with the preparation of the financial statements, ensuring they provide a true and fair view, and establishing necessary internal controls to prevent material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error. They are also responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern and must disclose relevant matters related to this assessment.\n\nOn the other hand, the Auditor's role is to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement. However, the Auditor acknowledges that their work cannot guarantee the detection of all material misstatements, particularly those arising from fraud, which often involves intentional concealment and is inherently more difficult to detect than errors.\n\nThe interaction between these responsibilities means that while the Directors are responsible for creating reliable financial statements through their controls and assessments, the Auditor's limitations imply that there is always a risk of undetected misstatements. This risk is heightened in cases of fraud, where the intentional nature of the misstatement can obscure it from both the Directors and the Auditor.\n\nUltimately, the reliability of the financial statements is contingent upon the effectiveness of the Directors' internal controls and assessments, as well as the Auditor's ability to apply professional judgment and skepticism. However, due to the inherent limitations of an audit, there remains a possibility that material misstatements could go undetected, thereby affecting the overall reliability of the financial statements.",
    "expected_answer": "The Directors are responsible for ensuring that the financial statements provide a true and fair view and maintain adequate internal controls to prevent misstatements. Meanwhile, the Auditor's responsibilities include obtaining reasonable assurance regarding the absence of material misstatements.
