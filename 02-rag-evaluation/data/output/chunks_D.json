The Company believes it is thus vulnerable to changing global energy policies.\n- The impact of Brexit on companies operating in the UK is still being monitored.

We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there is evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.\n\nWe tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account our understanding of the Group and its environment, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates. We planned our work to include sufficient work in respect of the parent company and the subsidiaries to enable us to provide an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.",

Financial assets\n\nLoans and receivables are recognised when the Company and Group become party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument.\n\nTrade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified as 'loans and receivables'. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial. Loans and receivables are assessed at each reporting date to determine a loss allowance under the expected credit loss model.\n\n## 2.14. Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are recognised when the Company and Group become party to a financial liability. Under IFRS 9, where there is a non-substantial modification of financial liabilities an immediate gain or loss on modification is recognised in the profit and loss account. This gain or loss is equal to the difference between the present value of cash flows under the original and modified terms discounted at the original effective interest rate.",

The Reorganization was undertaken to realize certain tax efficiencies for Kruger Products and to simplify its corporate structure and financial reporting. As a result of the Reorganization, Kruger Products, as the successor corporate entity to KPLP, now operates the business previously operated by KPLP. KP Tissue currently holds a 13.5% interest in Kruger Products.\n\n#### **LOOKING AHEAD**\n\nWe are highly encouraged by the ongoing progress of our financial results. The actions undertaken on pricing, cost management and the Memphis redeployment are driving a path to profitable growth.

The increase in revenue was due to selling price increases in all segments and regions, significantly higher sales volume in the AFH segment as the business recovered from the impact of COVID-19. Revenue was also favourably impacted by foreign exchange fluctuations on U.S. dollar sales (USD average 1.30 in Fiscal 2022 compared to 1.25 in Fiscal 2021).

Manufacturing costs increased primarily due to significantly increased pulp costs, high inflation on other input costs, higher sales volumes net of higher overhead absorption, the impact of labour shortages and productivity in Memphis manufacturing, increased plant overhead in Sherbrooke, higher plant maintenance costs and the unfavourable impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on U.S. dollar costs. Depreciation expense increased compared to Fiscal 2021 primarily due to accelerated depreciation related to the shutdown of certain LDC assets at the Memphis plant in January 2023 (refer to Business Highlights, Shutdown of Certain Memphis Plant Production Assets for additional details) and higher warehousing depreciation expense in Fiscal 2022. Freight costs increased significantly compared to Fiscal 2021 primarily due to increased freight rates resulting from cost inflation along with higher sales volumes.

The increase was primarily due to the release of a COVID-19 related AFH accounts receivable provision in the comparative period, a return to more normal travel levels, consulting and legal costs related to the Reorganization, higher selling expenses related to increased sales volume, and slightly higher advertising and promotion expenses, partially offset by foreign exchange gains related to working capital.

Each partner is entitled to its share of the Tax Distribution made in respect of any given year. KPLP determined that it was appropriate to reclassify a portion of its equity to Partnership units liability, since the Tax Distribution represents a contractual obligation to deliver cash and, as such, meets the definition of a financial liability for accounting purposes under IFRS. As of December 31, 2022, \\$133.6 million was recorded as a liability in respect of this obligation (December 31, 2021 - \\$173.2 million).

KPLP is subject to commodity price fluctuations since KPLP's main raw material is fibre, which changes price due to market conditions, and therefore can result in periodic earnings volatility in the short term. Historically, the industry has generally been able to mitigate its exposure to commodity price risk over the medium term by passing increases in its supply costs onto its customers through incremental price increases, depending on the supply and demand balance. The ability to eventually pass through the full amount of pulp and other commodity cost increases can be impacted by the competitive market situation. There can be no assurance that the historical ability to pass through increases in costs will continue to occur in the future. From time to time, KPLP enters into futures contracts to manage its commodity risk.

The determination of the temporary differences that are subject to the initial recognition exemption requires significant judgment. KPT has not recognized the deferred tax asset related to its investment in KPLP.\n\n#### **Leases**\n\nThe application of IFRS 16 requires a number of critical judgements, including identifying whether a contract (or part of a contract) includes a lease, determining whether it is reasonably certain that an extension or termination option will be exercised, determining whether variable payments are in-substance fixed, establishing whether there are multiple leases in an arrangement, and determining the stand-alone selling price of lease and non-lease components. The application of IFRS 16 also involves a number of key estimates, including estimating the lease term, determining the appropriate rate to discount lease payments, and assessing whether a Right-of-use asset is impaired.\n\n\n#### **ACCOUNTING CHANGES AND FUTURE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS**",

In October 2022, the IASB issued an amendment to IAS1, Non-current Liabilities with Covenants, to clarify how conditions with which an entity must comply within twelve months after the reporting period affect the classification of a liability.

In October 2022, the IASB issued an amendment to IAS1, Non-current Liabilities with Covenants, to clarify how conditions with which an entity must comply within twelve months after the reporting period affect the classification of a liability. The 2022 amendments also introduce additional disclosure requirements to improve the information an entity provides when its right to defer settlement of a liability is subject to compliance with covenants within twelve months after the reporting period. The 2022 amendments changed the effective date of the 2020 amendments. The mandatory effective date would be annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024, with early adoption permitted.

We are seeking platinum and palladium, the two major Platinum Group Elements (PGEs).\n\nPlatinum and palladium are essential for green energy technologies, including current usage in catalytic converters in combustion engines. However, major growth is expected to unfold in applications with green energy technologies and low carbon energy solutions.",

However, major growth is expected to unfold in applications with green energy technologies and low carbon energy solutions.\n\nPeako's exploration team completed an initial prospectivity review of the Eastman Project and identified ultramafic intrusions that we considered to have the potential to host a large PGE mineralised system. Subsequently, several phases of exploration were completed, aimed at delivering the highest priority prospects as well as improving our understanding of the controls on mineralisation. Importantly, these programs indicated that previous PGE exploration, which had focused on the discontinuous strataform chromite lenses, may not be the optimal exploration target. In parallel with exploration undertaken by the other explorers in the region, we now believe that PGE mineralisation is not limited to the chromite lenses but, importantly, that our targets should also include the stratabound mineralisation within the entire suit of ultramafic units.\n\nThis understanding became an important focus for the exploration effort, with the drill program that recently commenced, focusing on the ultramafic units. The results are expected to be released soon.",
