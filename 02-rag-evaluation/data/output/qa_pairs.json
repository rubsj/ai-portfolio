Additionally, an equity loss of $13.3 million was reported. The company's adoption of IFRS 16 Leases on January 1, 2019, and the subsequent restatement of fiscal 2018, indicated a shift in accounting treatment that could impact financial reporting going forward. Despite these challenges, the management expressed a commitment to achieve topline growth and improved profitability in 2023, while emphasizing the importance of monitoring input costs and currency fluctuations.

However, overall net income declined significantly from $42.3 million in Q4 2021 to $16.0 million in Q4 2022, mainly due to a much lower income tax recovery and increased depreciation and restructuring costs, despite an increase in adjusted EBITDA to $44.4 million due to higher selling prices and lower SG&A expenses.",

The decrease was primarily due to lower advertising and promotion expenses resulting from cost containment activities partially offset by consulting and legal costs related to the Reorganization and higher personnel costs.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n---\nBecause of the inherent limitations of an audit, there is a risk that we will not detect all irregularities, including those leading to a material misstatement in the financial statements or non-compliance with regulation. This risk increases the more that compliance with a law or regulation is removed from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, as we will be less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance.\n\nThe risk is also greater regarding irregularities occurring due to fraud rather than error, as fraud involves intentional concealment, forgery, collusion, omission or misrepresentation.\n\n\nThe specific procedures for this engagement that we designed and performed to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud, were as follows:",

    "expected_answer": "The financial figures show that there was a significant reduction in income from government grants due to Covid, dropping from $20,000 in 2021 to $0 in 2022. While sundry income increased to $1,863 from $350, the overall income remained low. On the expense side, there were increases in accounting fees, conferences and travel, depreciation, director fees, and particularly in heritage protection/community management fees, which rose significantly from $49,600 to $82,202. This suggests that while the company did not receive government support in 2022, it still faced rising costs, impacting its overall operational performance negatively compared to the previous year.",
