  "question": "How does Kruger Products' role in the Canadian market compare to its operations in the U.S.?",
  "response": "Kruger Products is the leading manufacturer of tissue products in Canada, holding a significant market share in both the consumer and Away-From-Home (AFH) segments. In contrast, while it has a presence in the U.S. market, particularly through the White Cloud brand and private label products, its operations there are not as dominant as in Canada. The company aims to expand its U.S. operations, focusing on high-end private label business and growing the White Cloud brand among additional U.S. retailers, indicating a strategy to enhance its market position in the U.S. but still primarily maintains its leadership in the Canadian market."
