  "question": "What exploration tenements has the Company applied for in the years ending 30 June 2021 and 30 June 2022, what financial implications arose from the relinquishing of exploration tenure in the Paterson region, and how do the prepayments for tenement rents relate to these applications and their associated costs?",
  "response": "In the year ending 30 June 2022, the Company applied for exploration tenements E80/5658, E80/5703, E80/5704, E80/5706, E80/5758, and E80/5779. In the prior year ending 30 June 2021, the Company applied for exploration tenements E80/5472, E80/5520, E80/5623, and E80/5624, as well as E80/5346 in March 2019.\n\nThe financial implications arising from the relinquishing of exploration tenure in the Paterson region included the write-off of the carrying value of the exploration licence E45/3278, which was \\$94,039 as of 30 June 2022. Additionally, costs associated with the three licence applications that were relinquished had not been capitalised, meaning they would not be recoverable.\n\nRegarding the prepayments for tenement rents, if a tenement is granted, the rent paid on application will cover the rent required for the first year of exploration in that tenement. However, if a tenement is not granted, the rent paid on application is fully refundable. As of 30 June 2022, the tenement applications had not been granted, indicating that any prepayments made for these applications would be subject to refund."
