    "question": "How do the responsibilities of the Directors and the limitations of the Auditor's responsibilities interact to influence the overall reliability of the financial statements, particularly in regard to the potential for material misstatements due to fraud or error?",
    "answer": "The Directors are responsible for ensuring that the financial statements provide a true and fair view and maintain adequate internal controls to prevent misstatements. Meanwhile, the Auditor's responsibilities include obtaining reasonable assurance regarding the absence of material misstatements. However, due to inherent limitations of an audit, which include the potential for fraud and the recognition that not all irregularities may be detected, the reliability of the financial statements can be compromised. The interaction between these responsibilities highlights a reliance on the Directors' integrity and controls while acknowledging the Auditor's limitations in identifying material misstatements."
