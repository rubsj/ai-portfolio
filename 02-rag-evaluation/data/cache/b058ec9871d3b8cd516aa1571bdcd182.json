    "question": "How did corporate and other costs, selling, general and administrative expenses, and adjusted EBITDA contribute to the overall net income changes in Q4 2022 compared to Q4 2021?",
    "answer": "In Q4 2022, corporate and other costs increased to a loss of $4.0 million from a loss of $3.7 million in Q4 2021, which negatively impacted net income. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to $30.6 million from $31.7 million, providing some relief to net income. However, overall net income declined significantly from $42.3 million in Q4 2021 to $16.0 million in Q4 2022, mainly due to a much lower income tax recovery and increased depreciation and restructuring costs, despite an increase in adjusted EBITDA to $44.4 million due to higher selling prices and lower SG&A expenses."
