    "question": "What was the total amount of Tax Distribution declared to KPT in 2022, what was the outcome of the Tax Distribution for KPLP in 2023, and how does the Reorganization affect future Tax Distribution obligations?",
    "answer": "In 2022, KPT received a Tax Distribution of $2.1 million from KPLP, which was part of a larger Tax Distribution of $14.1 million declared on February 28, 2022. In 2023, there was no Tax Distribution declared, and due to the Reorganization, future Tax Distributions are not required since Kruger Products, the successor to KPLP, is a corporate entity taxable directly."
