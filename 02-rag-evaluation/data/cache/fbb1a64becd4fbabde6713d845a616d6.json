    "question": "What exploration tenements has the Company applied for in the years ending 30 June 2021 and 30 June 2022, what financial implications arose from the relinquishing of exploration tenure in the Paterson region, and how do the prepayments for tenement rents relate to these applications and their associated costs?",
    "answer": "The Company applied for exploration tenements E80/5658, E80/5703, E80/5704, E80/5706, E80/5758, and E80/5779 in the year ending 30 June 2022, while prior applications in the year ending 30 June 2021 included E80/5472, E80/5520, E80/5623, and E80/5624, along with E80/5346 in March 2019. The relinquishment of exploration tenure in the Paterson region on 19 September 2022 led to the write-off of the carrying value of exploration licence E45/3278, amounting to $94,039, as costs for its three licence applications were not capitalised. Additionally, prepayments for tenement rent amounted to $68,912 for the year, contributing to a total prepayment balance of $176,569 at the end of the year, which indicates the Company's investment in exploration activities despite the challenges faced with tenement approvals."
