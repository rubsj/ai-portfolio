  "question": "What was the total amount of Tax Distribution declared to KPT in 2022, what was the outcome of the Tax Distribution for KPLP in 2023, and how does the Reorganization affect future Tax Distribution obligations?",
  "response": "The total amount of Tax Distribution declared to KPT in 2022 was \\$2.1 million. In 2023, there was no Tax Distribution declared. The Reorganization affects future Tax Distribution obligations by indicating that the Tax Distribution is not required in future periods, as Kruger Products, the successor to KPLP, is a corporate entity and is therefore subject to tax directly."
