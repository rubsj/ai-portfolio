  "question": "Why might the appointment of Paul Kitto as Non-Executive Technical Director be significant for Peako?",
  "response": "The appointment of Paul Kitto as Non-Executive Technical Director might be significant for Peako because he brings over thirty years of experience in the mining industry, including leadership roles in exploration and management. His extensive background in discovering multi-million ounce gold deposits and his expertise in various deposit types, particularly gold and base metals, can enhance Peako's exploration efforts and strategic direction. Additionally, his previous roles, such as Exploration Manager for Newcrest Mining Ltd and CEO of Ampella Mining Ltd, indicate a strong track record in the industry, which could contribute to the company's growth and success in the Eastman PGE Project and beyond."
