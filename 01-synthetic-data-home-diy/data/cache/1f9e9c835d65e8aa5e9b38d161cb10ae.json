    "question": "How do I unclog a bathroom sink drain?",
    "answer": "To unclog a bathroom sink drain, follow these detailed steps: 1. **Gather your tools**: You will need a plunger, a bucket, and an old towel or rag. 2. **Clear the area**: Remove any items from around the sink and place a bucket under the sink to catch any water that may spill. 3. **Check for standing water**: If there is water in the sink, remove it with a cup or a small container. 4. **Use the plunger**: Place the plunger over the drain, ensuring it covers the entire opening. Press down firmly and then pull up quickly to create suction. Repeat this motion about 10-15 times. 5. **Test the drain**: After plunging, run hot water in the sink to see if the clog has cleared. If water drains slowly, repeat plunging. 6. **Use a towel**: If the clog persists, use a towel to cover the overflow hole (if applicable) and plunge again. This will create better suction. 7. **Check the trap**: If the sink is still clogged, you may need to check the P-trap (the U-shaped pipe under the sink). Place a bucket under the trap, unscrew the slip nuts with your hands (or a wrench if needed), and remove the trap. Clean out any debris inside the trap. 8. **Reassemble**: After cleaning, reattach the trap, ensuring all connections are tight. 9. **Run water**: Finally, run water to ensure the drain is flowing freely. If it is still clogged, you may need to consult a professional.",

    "safety_info": "Always wear gloves when handling plumbing fixtures or debris. Be cautious when using a plunger to avoid splashing. If you feel resistance when unscrewing pipes, stop and check for any signs of corrosion or damage before proceeding.",
    "tips": "If using a plunger, ensure there is enough water in the sink to cover the rubber part of the plunger for maximum effectiveness. If the clog remains after multiple attempts, consider using a plumbing snake or contacting a professional."
