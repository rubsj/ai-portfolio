    "question": "How do I fix a leaky kitchen faucet?",
    "answer": "To fix a leaky kitchen faucet, start by identifying the source of the leak, which is usually from the faucet handle or spout. The first step is to disconnect the water supply by turning off the valves under the sink. If you don\u2019t see any valves, turn off the main water supply. Next, put on gloves and goggles for protection. Use a screwdriver to remove the handle, which may involve loosening a screw or lifting off a decorative cap. Once the handle is off, inspect the O-ring or washer inside for wear and tear, which is often the cause of leaks. Replace these parts if they appear damaged; they can be found at a local hardware store or online. Reassemble the faucet by reversing the steps, turning the water supply back on, and checking for leaks. If the faucet still leaks after replacement, you may need to call a licensed plumber for further inspection.",
