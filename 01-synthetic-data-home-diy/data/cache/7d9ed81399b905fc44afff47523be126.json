    "question": "How do I replace a leaky kitchen faucet cartridge?",
    "answer": "To replace a leaky kitchen faucet cartridge, start by identifying the type of faucet you have (compression, cartridge, ball, or ceramic disk) as this determines the cartridge type. After identifying it, first disconnect the water supply by turning off the shut-off valves under the sink. If you can't find these, turn off the main water supply for your home. Next, put on safety goggles and gloves to protect yourself from any debris and water. Remove the handle by loosening the screw underneath or at the back (you may need a screwdriver or an adjustable wrench). Once the handle is off, use a wrench to unscrew the retaining nut that holds the cartridge in place. Pull out the old cartridge and take it with you to the hardware store to ensure you get an exact match. Install the new cartridge by reversing the steps: insert it into the faucet, secure it with the retaining nut, replace the handle, and reconnect the water supply. Turn the water back on and check for leaks. If the faucet still leaks after replacing the cartridge, the issue may lie with the O-rings or seals, which also need to be replaced.",
