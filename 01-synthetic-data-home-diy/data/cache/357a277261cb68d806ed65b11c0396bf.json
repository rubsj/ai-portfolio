    "question": "How do I replace a faulty electrical outlet?",
    "answer": "To replace a faulty electrical outlet, start by identifying the issue, which could be frequent tripping of the circuit breaker, burning smell, or physical damage to the outlet itself. Before beginning any work, **disconnect power at the breaker box** to ensure complete safety. Wear **insulated gloves and safety goggles** to protect against electrical shocks and debris. Using a flathead screwdriver, remove the outlet cover plate, and then use a Phillips screwdriver to detach the outlet from the electrical box. Carefully pull the outlet out to expose the wiring. Take note of how the wires are connected (you can take a photo for reference). Disconnect the wires from the old outlet and connect them to the new outlet in the same configuration: black (or red) wires to the brass screws, white wires to the silver screws, and the ground wire (green or bare) to the green screw. Once the new outlet is wired, carefully tuck it back into the box and reattach it with the screws. Replace the cover plate and restore power at the breaker box. Test the outlet with a lamp or a voltage tester. If it doesn\u2019t work, double-check your connections and ensure the breaker is reset. If the outlet still fails to function, or if you're unsure about any steps, **call a licensed electrician** to avoid hazards. Frequent issues include loose connections or incorrect wiring, so always ensure your connections are tight and follow the color codes properly. Avoid overloading outlets with too many devices, which can lead to overheating and damage.",
