    "equipment_problem": "The light switch is faulty and needs replacement.",
    "tools_required": [
      "Screwdriver",
      "Wire stripper",
      "Voltage tester",
      "Electrical tape",
      "Replacement switch"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Turn off the power at the circuit breaker for the switch you are replacing.",
      "Use a voltage tester to confirm that the power is off by checking the wires connected to the existing switch.",
      "Remove the switch cover plate by unscrewing it with a screwdriver.",
      "Unscrew the existing switch from the electrical box and gently pull it out to expose the wiring.",
      "Take note of how the wires are connected to the switch; you may want to take a photo for reference.",
      "Disconnect the wires from the old switch by unscrewing the terminal screws or pulling off the wire connectors.",
      "Prepare the new switch by stripping about 1/2 inch of insulation from the ends of the wires if necessary.",
      "Connect the wires to the corresponding terminals on the new switch (usually black to black for hot, white to white for neutral, and green or bare for ground).",
      "Secure the new switch into the electrical box and replace the cover plate.",
      "Turn the power back on at the circuit breaker and test the switch."
    ],
    "safety_info": "Always ensure the power is completely turned off before working on electrical components. Use a voltage tester to double-check that there is no electrical current in the wires. If you are unsure or uncomfortable at any step, consult a licensed electrician.",
    "tips": "Label the wires if you're unsure about their connections. If the switch is part of a multi-switch setup, make sure to understand how they interact before disconnecting anything."
