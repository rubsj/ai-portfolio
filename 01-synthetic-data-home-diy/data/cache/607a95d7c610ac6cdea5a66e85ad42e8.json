    "question": "How can I replace a broken tile in my bathroom floor?",
    "answer": "Replacing a broken tile in your bathroom floor involves several steps, including removing the damaged tile, preparing the surface, and installing a new tile. First, gather your tools and materials. You will need a grout saw or utility knife, a chisel, a hammer, thin-set mortar, a trowel, a new tile that matches your existing tiles, grout, and a sponge. Start by carefully removing the grout around the broken tile with the grout saw. Once the grout is removed, use the chisel and hammer to gently tap and lift the broken tile out of the floor. Be cautious not to damage the surrounding tiles during this process. Clean the area thoroughly, removing any old adhesive or debris. Apply a layer of thin-set mortar to the substrate using the trowel, then place the new tile into position, pressing it down firmly. Allow the mortar to set according to the manufacturer's instructions. Once set, apply grout around the edges of the tile, smoothing it with a damp sponge. Finally, let the grout cure as recommended. This process restores your bathroom floor's appearance and prevents further damage.",
