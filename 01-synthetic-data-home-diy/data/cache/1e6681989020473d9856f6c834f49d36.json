    "question": "How do I fix a leaking kitchen faucet?",
    "answer": "To fix a leaking kitchen faucet, start by identifying the type of faucet you have (compression, cartridge, ball, or disc) since the repair method may differ. First, turn off the water supply to the faucet under the sink. Then, disconnect the water supply lines using an adjustable wrench or a pair of pliers. Carefully remove the faucet handle by unscrewing the screw at the back or bottom of the handle; you may need a flathead screwdriver to pry off a decorative cap. Once the handle is off, you can access the cartridge or compression washer, which is often the source of the leak. If it\u2019s a cartridge faucet, simply pull out the cartridge and replace it with a new one. For compression faucets, replace the rubber washer at the base of the valve. After the replacement, reassemble the faucet in reverse order, reconnect the supply lines, and turn the water supply back on to check for leaks.",
