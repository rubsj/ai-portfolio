    "question": "How do I repair a leaking kitchen faucet?",
    "answer": "To repair a leaking kitchen faucet, you will need to identify the type of faucet you have (compression, cartridge, ball, or ceramic disk) and replace the worn-out parts accordingly. This guide focuses on cartridge faucets, which are common. Follow these steps:",
    "equipment_problem": "Leaking kitchen faucet, likely due to worn-out cartridge or seals.",
    "tools_required": [
      "Adjustable wrench",
      "Screwdriver set",
      "Replacement cartridge",
      "Plumber's grease",
      "Towel or rag"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "1. Turn off the water supply to the faucet by locating the shut-off valves under the sink and turning them clockwise.",
      "2. Open the faucet to drain any remaining water and relieve pressure.",
      "3. Use a screwdriver to remove the handle screw, then lift off the handle to expose the cartridge underneath.",
      "4. Use an adjustable wrench to loosen and remove the retaining nut that holds the cartridge in place.",
      "5. Pull out the old cartridge and inspect it for damage. If it's worn or cracked, replace it with a new one of the same type. To identify the cartridge type, compare it with online diagrams or take it to a hardware store for assistance.",
      "6. Apply plumber's grease to the new cartridge and insert it into the faucet body, ensuring it is oriented correctly based on any alignment marks or features.",
      "7. Replace the retaining nut and tighten it securely, but do not overtighten.",
      "8. Reattach the handle and secure it with the screw.",
      "9. Turn the water supply back on and test for leaks by running the faucet. Check for any drips around the handle and under the sink. If leaks persist, double-check the cartridge installation and ensure all parts are properly seated."
    ],
    "safety_info": "Always ensure the water supply is turned off before starting any repair. Use caution when handling tools and parts, and wear safety goggles to protect your eyes from debris. Be careful with sharp edges when accessing the faucet parts.",
    "tips": "Keep a towel handy to wipe up any spills. If you're unsure about the type of cartridge, take the old one to the hardware store for a match. Check for leaks after each step of the repair process to catch any issues early. Make sure the new cartridge is seated properly before reassembling the faucet."
