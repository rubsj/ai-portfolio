      "Replacement washer or cartridge"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "1. Turn off the water supply to the faucet. Look under the sink for the hot and cold water shut-off valves and turn them clockwise until they are fully closed.",
      "2. Open the faucet to drain any remaining water in the lines. This will prevent any spills during the repair process.",

      "7. Inspect the washer or cartridge for damage. If it looks worn or cracked, replace it with a new one. If your faucet has a washer, remove it and replace it with a new washer of the same size.",
      "8. Before reassembling, wrap plumber's tape around the threads of the faucet to ensure a good seal and prevent future leaks.",
      "9. Reinsert the cartridge or stem back into the faucet body in the same orientation as before.",
      "10. Reattach the retaining nut or collar and tighten it securely using the adjustable wrench.",
      "11. Place the handle back on the faucet and secure it with the screw. Replace any decorative caps if applicable.",
      "12. Turn the water supply back on by turning the shut-off valves counterclockwise. Check for leaks by turning on the faucet and observing for any dripping.",
      "13. If there are no leaks, your repair is complete!"
    ],

    "tips": "Keep a towel handy to wipe up any water that may spill during the repair process. If you are unsure about the type of washer or cartridge to buy, take the old one with you to the hardware store for comparison."
