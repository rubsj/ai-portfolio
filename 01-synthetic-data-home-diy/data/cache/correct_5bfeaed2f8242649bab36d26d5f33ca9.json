    "question": "How do I replace a leaky faucet in my kitchen?",
    "answer": "Replacing a leaky kitchen faucet involves several steps, including turning off the water supply, removing the old faucet, and installing the new one. First, ensure you have all necessary tools and materials before starting. To choose the correct replacement faucet, measure the existing faucet's height and width, and check if it has a single or double handle. You can purchase a new faucet at a local hardware store or online, ensuring it matches your existing plumbing setup. Follow these steps carefully to ensure a successful repair, and if the new faucet leaks after installation, check the connections and reapply plumber's tape as needed.",
