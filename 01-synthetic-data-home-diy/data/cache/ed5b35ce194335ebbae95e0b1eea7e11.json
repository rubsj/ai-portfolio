    "question": "How can I replace a broken toilet flange in my bathroom?",
    "answer": "To replace a toilet flange, you'll need to follow these detailed steps carefully. This task involves working with plumbing and can be complex, so ensure you're comfortable with it before proceeding. If you're unsure at any point, it's best to contact a professional plumber.\n\n1. **Turn Off Water Supply**: Locate the shut-off valve behind the toilet and turn it clockwise to stop the water flow.\n2. **Remove the Toilet**: Disconnect the water supply line from the toilet tank using an adjustable wrench. Then, remove the nuts securing the toilet to the floor using a socket wrench. Carefully lift the toilet off the flange and set it aside on a soft surface to avoid damage.\n3. **Inspect the Flange**: Check the toilet flange for damage. If it's cracked, broken, or rusted, it needs to be replaced. If it's just loose, you might be able to re-secure it instead.\n4. **Remove the Old Flange**: Unscrew the old flange from the floor, taking care not to damage the surrounding flooring. You may need a pry bar for stubborn flanges. If the flange is glued, use a utility knife to cut around it.\n5. **Clean the Area**: Thoroughly clean the area around the drain pipe to remove any debris, wax, or old sealant. This ensures a good seal for the new flange.\n6. **Install the New Flange**: Place the new flange over the drain pipe, ensuring it is centered and level. Use screws to secure it to the floor, making sure it's tight and stable.\n7. **Reinstall the Toilet**: Apply a new wax ring to the flange. Carefully lift the toilet back into place, aligning the bolts with the holes in the toilet base. Press down gently to compress the wax ring.\n8. **Reconnect Everything**: Secure the toilet with nuts over the bolts, reconnect the water supply line, and turn the water supply back on. Check for leaks.\n9. **Test the Toilet**: Flush the toilet a few times to ensure it\u2019s functioning properly and there are no leaks around the base or the water supply line.",
