    "question": "How do I replace a malfunctioning thermostat in my HVAC system?",
    "answer": "To replace a malfunctioning thermostat, first, identify the specific problem by checking if the thermostat is unresponsive or if the temperature settings do not match your home\u2019s temperature. Next, locate the screws holding the thermostat cover in place, and gently remove the cover. Disconnect the old thermostat from the wall by unscrewing the mounting plate and noting where each wire connects (often labeled as R, W, Y, G, etc.). Purchase a compatible replacement thermostat at a local hardware store or online, ensuring it matches your HVAC system type. After receiving your new thermostat, connect the wires to the corresponding terminals, secure the mounting plate, and attach the new cover. Restore power to the HVAC system and test the thermostat by adjusting settings and observing if the system responds accordingly. If the fix doesn\u2019t work, double-check the wiring connections and consult the user manual for troubleshooting. If the thermostat still malfunctions, it\u2019s advisable to contact a licensed HVAC technician for further diagnosis and repair.",
